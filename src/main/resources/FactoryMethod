What is Factory Method?
A: A method of java class which is capable of constructing and returns its own class object.

When a bean class contains a private constructor we cannot create its object from outside. 
Then we can give instructions to spring container to create object of bean class by using factory method.

Note:
-->Factory methods can be static or non static [instance]
-->Factory method internally calls constructor at the time of object creation
-->Factory methods should be public methods, So that can be accessed from outside the class.
--><factory-method> Attribute is used to to configure factory method.
-->If factory method expects any arguments then pass arguments using <constructor-arg>

Eg: Static Factory Methods
Class c=Class.forName(“ClassName”)
Thread t=Thread.currentThread()
Calendar cl=Calander.getInstance()

Eg: Instance Methods
String s=new String(“Sireesh”)
String s=s.concat(“Vattikuti”)
